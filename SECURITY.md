# Security Policy

We take the security of p2p-path-finder seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of
potential vulnerabilities.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and backported to released tags when
feasible. Pre-release builds toward `1.0.0-rc` receive priority because they stabilise the
API that downstream consumers rely on.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Email [i.pinchuk.work@gmail.com](mailto:i.pinchuk.work@gmail.com) with a clear description
  of the issue and steps to reproduce it. Please encrypt sensitive details if possible.
- Expect an acknowledgement within **3 business days**. If you do not hear back in that
  window, feel free to send a follow-up message.
- We will provide a remediation plan or request additional information within **10
  business days**.
- Once a fix is ready we will coordinate a release and credit the reporter unless anonymity
  is requested.

Please avoid filing public issues or pull requests for unresolved security findings so the
broader ecosystem is not exposed before a fix is available.

## Preferred languages

We can correspond in English or Ukrainian.
