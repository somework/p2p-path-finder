# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone who
participates in the p2p-path-finder project. We expect contributors, maintainers and
community members to:

- Use inclusive and respectful language.
- Show empathy toward others and consider the impact of their decisions.
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully and offer it thoughtfully.
- Focus on what is best for the project and the community.

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following behaviour is not tolerated:

- Harassment of any kind, including offensive comments related to personal
  characteristics or choices.
- Intimidation, threats, stalking or unwelcome attention.
- Publishing private information such as physical or email addresses without
  explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Reporting

If you observe or experience a Code of Conduct violation, please report it to the
maintainers at [i.pinchuk.work@gmail.com](mailto:i.pinchuk.work@gmail.com). Include relevant
context (dates, links, supporting material) so we can review the situation quickly.
Reports are treated as confidentially as possible and are only shared with the
individuals directly responsible for resolving the issue.

## Enforcement

The maintainers will review every report, take action deemed appropriate and communicate
the outcome to the affected parties. Actions may include warnings, requests for apology,
temporary or permanent suspension from project spaces or other responses proportional to
the incident.

Repeated or severe violations may result in removal from the project community. Appeals
should be sent to the maintainers via the same contact address.
