# Subtask 0006.18: Add Concurrency/Immutability Tests

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Add tests to verify value objects are immutable and services are reusable across searches.

## Actions

- [ ] Test value objects cannot be mutated
- [ ] Test OrderBook reuse across multiple searches
- [ ] Test PathSearchConfig reuse
- [ ] Test PathFinderService thread-safety assumptions
- [ ] Add to ConcurrencyTest.php (create if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Immutability verified for all value objects
- OrderBook reuse tested
- PathSearchConfig reuse tested
- Service reusability verified
- Tests comprehensive

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Immutability verified
- [ ] Reuse safety verified
- [ ] Tests comprehensive
- [ ] Added to appropriate test file
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testValueObjectsImmutable()`
- `testOrderBookReusable()`
- `testPathSearchConfigReusable()`
- `testServiceReusability()`
