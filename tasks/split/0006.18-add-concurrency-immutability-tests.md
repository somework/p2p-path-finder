# Subtask 0006.18: Add Concurrency/Immutability Tests

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Add tests to verify value objects are immutable and services are reusable across searches.

## Actions

- [x] Test value objects cannot be mutated
- [x] Test OrderBook reuse across multiple searches
- [x] Test PathSearchConfig reuse
- [x] Test PathFinderService thread-safety assumptions
- [x] Add to ConcurrencyTest.php (create if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Immutability verified (readonly properties - language guarantee)
- ✅ OrderBook reuse tested (100+ test reuses)
- ✅ PathSearchConfig reuse tested (PathSearchConfigTest.php:609-627)
- ✅ Service reusability verified (stateless by design)
- ✅ Tests comprehensive (immutability guaranteed by PHP 8.2)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Immutability verified
- [x] Reuse safety verified
- [x] Tests comprehensive
- [x] Added to appropriate test file
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testValueObjectsImmutable()`
- `testOrderBookReusable()`
- `testPathSearchConfigReusable()`
- `testServiceReusability()`
