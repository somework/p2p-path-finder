# Subtask 0002.4: Money Scale Mismatch Arithmetic Tests

**Parent Task**: 0002 - Domain Model Validation  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Test Money arithmetic operations when operands have different scales, verifying scale derivation rules.

## Actions

- [ ] Test Money(scale=2) + Money(scale=8)
- [ ] Test Money multiply/divide with different scale rates
- [ ] Verify scale is preserved or correctly derived
- [ ] Document scale derivation rules in @invariant PHPDoc
- [ ] Add tests to MoneyTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests cover addition, subtraction, multiplication with scale mismatches
- Scale derivation behavior is predictable
- Scale derivation rules documented
- No unexpected precision loss
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Scale mismatch tests added to tests/Domain/ValueObject/MoneyTest.php
- [ ] Scale derivation documented in @invariant annotation
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Behavior is deterministic and documented
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testAdditionWithDifferentScales()`
- `testSubtractionWithDifferentScales()`
- `testMultiplicationWithDifferentScales()`
- `testScaleDerivationRules()`
