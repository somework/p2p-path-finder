# Subtask 0001.8: JSON Serialization Contract - SearchOutcome & SearchGuardReport

**Parent Task**: 0001 - Public API Finalization  
**Effort**: S (1-2h)  
**Dependencies**: 0001.7

## Description

Document the JSON serialization structure for `SearchOutcome` and `SearchGuardReport` classes.

## Actions

- [x] Document SearchOutcome::jsonSerialize() structure
- [x] Document SearchGuardReport::jsonSerialize() structure
- [x] Add to docs/api-contracts.md
- [x] List all fields with types
- [x] Include example JSON outputs
- [x] Document guard report metadata fields

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] SearchOutcome JSON structure documented in api-contracts.md
- [x] SearchGuardReport JSON structure documented
- [x] All fields listed with types
- [x] Example JSON outputs included for both
- [x] Metadata fields (expansions, visited, elapsed, breaches) documented

## Definition of Done

- [x] SearchOutcome JSON structure documented
- [x] SearchGuardReport JSON structure documented
- [x] Examples added to api-contracts.md
- [x] Document updated with clear examples
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Notes

This task was completed as part of 0001.7 (JSON Contract - PathResult). The docs/api-contracts.md file created in that task includes comprehensive documentation for both SearchOutcome and SearchGuardReport with:

- Complete JSON structure examples
- All fields documented with types (including nested objects)
- Detailed tables for limits, metrics, and breached objects
- Example outputs showing real usage
- Notes about behavior and constraints
- Version history

See docs/api-contracts.md lines 326-463 for the full documentation.

## Tests Needed

None directly for this documentation task, but see 0001.10 for JSON serialization tests.
