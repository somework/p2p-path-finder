# Subtask 0003.2: Grep Audit - BCMath Remnants

**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Search for any remaining BCMath function calls and migrate them to BigDecimal for consistency.

## Actions

- [x] Search for: `bc(add|sub|mul|div|pow|comp|scale|sqrt|mod)`
- [x] Document any findings with file path and line number
- [x] Migrate any BCMath calls to BigDecimal
- [x] Update tests if needed
- [x] Verify no BCMath functions remain

## Acceptance Criteria

- Search completed across entire codebase
- All BCMath calls documented
- All BCMath calls migrated to BigDecimal or justified
- Tests updated if behavior changes
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [x] Search completed
- [x] All BCMath calls migrated or justified
- [x] Tests updated and passing
- [x] Documentation updated if needed
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Run full test suite after migration
- Verify determinism tests still pass
- Add regression tests if new edge cases found
