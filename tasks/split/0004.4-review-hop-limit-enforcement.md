# Subtask 0004.4: Review Hop Limit Enforcement

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify hop limits are enforced correctly at both the search level and callback level.

## Actions

- [x] Verify minimum hops filter in PathFinderService callback
- [x] Verify maximum hops check in PathFinder search loop
- [x] Document hop enforcement sequence
- [x] Ensure no paths violate limits
- [x] Verify limits are inclusive/exclusive as documented

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hop enforcement mechanism reviewed
- Minimum and maximum hops verified
- Enforcement sequence documented
- No bugs found
- Behavior matches documentation

## Definition of Done

- [x] Hop enforcement verified correct
- [x] Enforcement sequence documented
- [x] No bugs found
- [x] Tests verify hop limits
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add tests if gaps found:
- Test paths respect minimum hops
- Test paths respect maximum hops
- Test hop count at boundaries
