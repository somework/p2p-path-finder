# Subtask 0003.5: Audit PathFinder Scale Usage

**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify PathFinder::SCALE (18) is used consistently for all tolerance and cost calculations.

## Actions

- [x] Verify PathFinder::SCALE (18) used for tolerance/cost calculations
- [x] Verify SearchState cost normalization uses SCALE
- [x] Verify CandidatePath cost normalization uses SCALE
- [x] Verify DecimalTolerance uses SCALE
- [x] Document findings and any deviations

## Acceptance Criteria

- All PathFinder scale usage verified
- SCALE constant (18) used consistently
- Any deviations documented and justified
- Cost calculations use correct scale
- Tolerance calculations use correct scale

## Definition of Done

- [x] All PathFinder scale usage verified
- [x] SCALE constant used consistently
- [x] Any deviations documented and justified
- [x] Findings documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Verify existing scale tests pass
- Add tests if gaps found in scale handling
