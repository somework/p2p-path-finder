# Subtask 0006.8: Add Tolerance Boundary Integration Tests

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Add integration tests for tolerance boundaries to ensure correct behavior in real-world scenarios.

## Actions

- [ ] Test min=max tolerance (zero flexibility)
- [ ] Test very wide tolerance (0.0 to 0.99)
- [ ] Test tolerance at 0 and near 1.0
- [ ] Add to PathFinderServiceIntegrationTest.php
- [ ] Verify expected paths found

## Acceptance Criteria

- Zero tolerance (min=max) tested
- Wide tolerance tested
- Boundary values (0, near 1.0) tested
- All edge cases covered
- Tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tolerance boundary tests added
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Added to integration test file
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testZeroToleranceIntegration()`
- `testWideToleranceIntegration()`
- `testToleranceBoundaryValues()`
