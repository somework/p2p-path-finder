# Subtask 0002.5: ExchangeRate Extreme Rate Tests

**Parent Task**: 0002 - Domain Model Validation  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Test ExchangeRate with very small and very large rates to ensure conversions maintain precision.

## Actions

- [x] Test very small rates (e.g., "0.00000001")
- [x] Test very large rates (e.g., "100000000.0")
- [x] Test conversion with extreme rates
- [x] Verify precision maintained
- [x] Add tests to ExchangeRateTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests cover very small rates
- Tests cover very large rates
- Conversions produce correct results
- Precision maintained
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [x] Extreme rate tests added to tests/Domain/ValueObject/ExchangeRateTest.php
- [x] Conversions maintain precision
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testVerySmallExchangeRate()`
- `testVeryLargeExchangeRate()`
- `testConversionWithExtremeRates()`
