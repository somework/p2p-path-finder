# Subtask 0006.16: Review Mutation Testing Report

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Run Infection mutation testing and analyze surviving mutants to identify test gaps.

## Actions

- [ ] Run `INFECTION=1 XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/infection`
- [ ] Analyze surviving mutants in report
- [ ] Identify high-value mutants to kill (critical code paths)
- [ ] List areas needing better tests
- [ ] Document findings with priorities

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mutation testing run successfully
- Report analyzed comprehensively
- Surviving mutants catalogued
- High-value mutants identified
- Test gaps prioritized

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Mutation report analyzed
- [ ] Surviving mutants catalogued
- [ ] Test gaps identified
- [ ] Findings documented with priorities
- [ ] Ready for test creation (see 0006.17)

## Tests Needed

None directly - findings will inform test creation in 0006.17.
