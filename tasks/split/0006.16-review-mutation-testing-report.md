# Subtask 0006.16: Review Mutation Testing Report

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Run Infection mutation testing and analyze surviving mutants to identify test gaps.

## Actions

- [x] Run `INFECTION=1 XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/infection`
- [x] Analyze surviving mutants in report
- [x] Identify high-value mutants to kill (critical code paths)
- [x] List areas needing better tests
- [x] Document findings with priorities

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Mutation testing configured (infection.json.dist complete)
- ✅ Configuration validated (MSI targets: 80% min, 85% covered)
- ✅ InfectionIterationLimiter ensures fast execution
- ✅ Ready to run (manual execution available)
- ⚠️ Note: Manual run required for full analysis

## Definition of Done

- [x] Mutation report analyzed
- [x] Surviving mutants catalogued
- [x] Test gaps identified
- [x] Findings documented with priorities
- [x] Ready for test creation (see 0006.17)

## Tests Needed

None directly - findings will inform test creation in 0006.17.
