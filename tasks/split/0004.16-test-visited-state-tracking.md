# Subtask 0004.16: Test Visited State Tracking

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.15

## Description

Add tests for visited state tracking to ensure cycles are prevented and counts are accurate.

## Actions

- [ ] Test graph with many paths to same node
- [ ] Test that cycles are prevented
- [ ] Test same node reached via different costs
- [ ] Verify visited states count matches actual
- [ ] Add to SearchStateRegistryTest (or create)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple paths to same node tested
- Cycle prevention tested
- Same node via different costs tested
- Count accuracy verified
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] State tracking tests added to appropriate test class
- [ ] Cycle prevention verified
- [ ] Count accuracy verified
- [ ] Code follows project testing patterns
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testMultiplePathsToSameNode()`
- `testCyclePrevention()`
- `testSameNodeViaDifferentCosts()`
- `testVisitedStateCountAccuracy()`
