# Subtask 0004.16: Test Visited State Tracking

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.15

## Description

Add tests for visited state tracking to ensure cycles are prevented and counts are accurate.

## Actions

- [x] Test graph with many paths to same node
- [x] Test that cycles are prevented
- [x] Test same node reached via different costs
- [x] Verify visited states count matches actual
- [x] Add to SearchStateRegistryTest (or create)

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Multiple paths to same node tested
- ✅ Cycle prevention tested
- ✅ Same node via different costs tested
- ✅ Count accuracy verified
- ✅ All tests pass (8 tests, 46 assertions)

## Definition of Done

- [x] State tracking tests added to appropriate test class
- [x] Cycle prevention verified
- [x] Count accuracy verified
- [x] Code follows project testing patterns
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testMultiplePathsToSameNode()`
- `testCyclePrevention()`
- `testSameNodeViaDifferentCosts()`
- `testVisitedStateCountAccuracy()`
