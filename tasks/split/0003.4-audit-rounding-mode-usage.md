# Subtask 0003.4: Audit RoundingMode Usage

**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify all `toScale()` calls use `RoundingMode::HALF_UP` consistently or document exceptions.

## Actions

- [ ] Search for all `->toScale()` calls
- [ ] Verify all use `RoundingMode::HALF_UP` or document why not
- [ ] Search for `RoundingMode::` to find all uses
- [ ] Ensure no PHP `round()` calls (different tie-breaking)
- [ ] Document any exceptions with rationale

## Acceptance Criteria

- All toScale() calls reviewed
- All use HALF_UP or exception documented with rationale
- No problematic round() calls found
- Consistent rounding policy enforced
- Documentation updated if needed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All toScale() calls reviewed
- [ ] All use HALF_UP or exception documented
- [ ] No problematic round() calls found
- [ ] Findings documented
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Verify existing determinism tests pass
- Add tests for any newly standardized rounding
