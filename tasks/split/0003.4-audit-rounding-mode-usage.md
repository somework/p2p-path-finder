# Subtask 0003.4: Audit RoundingMode Usage

**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify all `toScale()` calls use `RoundingMode::HALF_UP` consistently or document exceptions.

## Actions

- [x] Search for all `->toScale()` calls
- [x] Verify all use `RoundingMode::HALF_UP` or document why not
- [x] Search for `RoundingMode::` to find all uses
- [x] Ensure no PHP `round()` calls (different tie-breaking)
- [x] Document any exceptions with rationale

## Acceptance Criteria

- All toScale() calls reviewed
- All use HALF_UP or exception documented with rationale
- No problematic round() calls found
- Consistent rounding policy enforced
- Documentation updated if needed

## Definition of Done

- [x] All toScale() calls reviewed
- [x] All use HALF_UP or exception documented
- [x] No problematic round() calls found
- [x] Findings documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Verify existing determinism tests pass
- Add tests for any newly standardized rounding
