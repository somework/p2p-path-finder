# Subtask 0001.11: Add @api Annotations

**Parent Task**: 0001 - Public API Finalization  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0001.1

## Description

Add `@api` PHPDoc tags to all public API classes and methods identified in the API inventory, and verify documentation generation respects these tags.

## Actions

- [ ] Add @api PHPDoc tag to all PUBLIC classes/methods from inventory
- [ ] Verify PHPDoc generator (bin/generate-phpdoc.php if exists) respects @api
- [ ] Test doc generation excludes @internal
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all public API surface
- [ ] Double-check against api-stability.md inventory

## Acceptance Criteria

- All public API classes have @api tag in class docblock
- All public API methods have @api tag
- @internal classes do not have @api tag
- Documentation generator tested (if applicable)
- Generated docs include @api, exclude @internal

## Definition of Done

- [ ] @api tags added to all public API surface
- [ ] PHPDoc generator tested (if exists)
- [ ] Generated docs verified to include @api, exclude @internal
- [ ] Consistency verified against api-stability.md
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Manual verification: grep for `@api` in all public classes
- If PHPDoc generator exists: generate docs and verify output
- Static analysis should pass without warnings
