# Subtask 0004.19: Add Missing Algorithm Tests

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: L (3-4h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.1-0004.18

## Description

Add comprehensive algorithm tests based on findings from previous subtasks, including adversarial graphs.

## Actions

- [x] Add adversarial graph tests (designed for worst-case)
- [x] Add boundary condition tests
- [x] Add guard stress tests (tight guards on complex graphs)
- [x] Add metamorphic properties if gaps found
- [x] Document test scenarios
- [x] Add to PathFinderTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All identified test gaps filled (15 new tests)
- ✅ Adversarial cases covered (complete graph, linear chain, star topology)
- ✅ Boundary conditions covered (tolerance 0%/99.9%, hops 1, topK 1, empty/disconnected graphs)
- ✅ Guard stress tests added (tight expansion/visited/time limits)
- ✅ Test suite comprehensive (37 assertions)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All identified test gaps filled
- [x] Adversarial cases covered
- [x] Test suite comprehensive
- [x] Test scenarios documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods based on gaps found:
- `testAdversarialGraphWorstCase()`
- `testBoundaryConditions()`
- `testGuardStressOnComplexGraph()`
- Additional tests as identified
