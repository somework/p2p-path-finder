# Subtask 0004.19: Add Missing Algorithm Tests

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: L (3-4h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.1-0004.18

## Description

Add comprehensive algorithm tests based on findings from previous subtasks, including adversarial graphs.

## Actions

- [ ] Add adversarial graph tests (designed for worst-case)
- [ ] Add boundary condition tests
- [ ] Add guard stress tests (tight guards on complex graphs)
- [ ] Add metamorphic properties if gaps found
- [ ] Document test scenarios
- [ ] Add to PathFinderTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- All identified test gaps filled
- Adversarial cases covered
- Boundary conditions covered
- Guard stress tests added
- Test suite comprehensive

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All identified test gaps filled
- [ ] Adversarial cases covered
- [ ] Test suite comprehensive
- [ ] Test scenarios documented
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods based on gaps found:
- `testAdversarialGraphWorstCase()`
- `testBoundaryConditions()`
- `testGuardStressOnComplexGraph()`
- Additional tests as identified
