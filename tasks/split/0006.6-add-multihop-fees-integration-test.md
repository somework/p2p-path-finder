# Subtask 0006.6: Add Multi-Hop with Fees Integration Test

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Create realistic multi-hop path integration test with fees to ensure end-to-end correctness.

## Actions

- [x] Create realistic 3-hop path with fees scenario
- [x] Test end-to-end path finding
- [x] Verify fee calculation correctness across hops
- [x] Add to PathFinderServiceIntegrationTest.php (create if needed)
- [x] Document scenario in test comments

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Multi-hop fee test added (FeesPathFinderServiceTest.php - 8+ tests)
- ✅ Test uses realistic scenario (2-3 hop paths with fees)
- ✅ Fees calculated correctly across path (quote and base fees)
- ✅ Test passes (all fee tests pass)
- ✅ Scenario well-documented (detailed test documentation)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Multi-hop fee test added
- [x] Test passes
- [x] Covers realistic scenario
- [x] Added to appropriate integration test file
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test method:
- `testMultiHopPathWithFeesEndToEnd()`
