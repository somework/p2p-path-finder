# Subtask 0004.13: Review Spend Constraints Propagation

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify SpendConstraints are computed and propagated correctly during path traversal.

## Actions

- [ ] Verify SpendConstraints computed correctly from ToleranceWindow
- [ ] Verify constraints updated correctly when traversing edges
- [ ] Check constraint violations caught early (pruning)
- [ ] Document constraint propagation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- Constraints computation verified correct
- Propagation logic verified correct
- Early violation detection confirmed
- Logic documented
- No off-by-one errors

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Constraints propagation reviewed
- [ ] Computation verified correct
- [ ] Early detection confirmed
- [ ] Findings documented
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add tests if gaps found (see 0004.14)
