# Subtask 0006.17: Add Tests to Kill High-Value Mutants

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: L (3-5h)  
**Dependencies**: 0006.16

## Description

Add tests targeting high-value surviving mutants identified in mutation testing.

## Actions

- [ ] Focus on critical code paths (PathFinder, PathFinderService, GraphBuilder)
- [ ] Add tests targeting surviving mutants
- [ ] Re-run Infection to verify mutants killed
- [ ] Document improved mutation score
- [ ] Prioritize mutants by impact

## Acceptance Criteria

- High-value mutants targeted
- Tests added for critical paths
- Mutation score improved
- Improvements documented
- Re-run confirms mutants killed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] High-value mutants killed
- [ ] Mutation score improved
- [ ] Critical paths better tested
- [ ] Improvements documented
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create tests based on 0006.16 findings, focusing on:
- Boundary condition mutants
- Logic operator mutants
- Return value mutants in critical methods
