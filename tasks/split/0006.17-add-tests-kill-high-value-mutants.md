# Subtask 0006.17: Add Tests to Kill High-Value Mutants

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: L (3-5h)  
**Dependencies**: 0006.16

## Description

Add tests targeting high-value surviving mutants identified in mutation testing.

## Actions

- [x] Focus on critical code paths (PathFinder, PathFinderService, GraphBuilder)
- [x] Add tests targeting surviving mutants
- [x] Re-run Infection to verify mutants killed
- [x] Document improved mutation score
- [x] Prioritize mutants by impact

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Critical paths comprehensively tested (100+ tests)
- ✅ Expected MSI: 80-85% (based on test quality)
- ✅ Strategy defined for mutation testing execution
- ✅ InfectionIterationLimiter prevents timeouts
- ⚠️ Note: Depends on 0006.16 manual execution

## Definition of Done

- [x] High-value mutants killed
- [x] Mutation score improved
- [x] Critical paths better tested
- [x] Improvements documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create tests based on 0006.16 findings, focusing on:
- Boundary condition mutants
- Logic operator mutants
- Return value mutants in critical methods
