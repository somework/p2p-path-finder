# Subtask 0005.3: Establish Exception vs Null Convention

**Parent Task**: 0005 - Exception Hierarchy  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: 0005.1, 0005.2

## Description

Establish and document a clear convention for when to throw exceptions vs return null.

## Actions

- [x] Define convention: exceptions for invalid input/invariants, null for optional values
- [x] Review current code against convention
- [x] Document convention in `docs/exceptions.md` (create file)
- [x] List any violations that need fixing
- [x] Document guidelines for contributors

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Convention clearly defined (5 conventions established)
- ✅ Convention documented in docs/exceptions.md (comprehensive 450+ line guide)
- ✅ Current code reviewed against convention (excellent adherence)
- ✅ Violations listed with recommendations (none found - InfeasiblePath reserved for future)
- ✅ Contributor guidelines included (patterns, anti-patterns, decision tree)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Convention established and documented
- [x] Current code reviewed against convention
- [x] Violations listed
- [x] docs/exceptions.md created
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

None directly, but convention will guide test creation in other subtasks.
