# Subtask 0004.17: Review Acceptance Callback Semantics

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: S (1-2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Review and document the acceptance callback contract including when it's called and what guarantees it has.

## Actions

- [x] Document callback contract (when called, guarantees)
- [x] Verify callback called only after basic validation
- [x] Check callback error handling
- [x] Document callback semantics in PHPDoc
- [x] Review callback integration with PathFinderService

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Callback contract documented (comprehensive audit report)
- ✅ Call timing verified (invoked when state reaches target, before result recording)
- ✅ Error handling reviewed (exceptions propagate to caller)
- ✅ Semantics clear in PHPDoc (35-line enhanced docblock)
- ✅ Integration verified (PathFinderService wrapper adds validation layer)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Callback contract documented
- [x] Call timing verified
- [x] Error handling reviewed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add tests if gaps found (see 0004.18)
