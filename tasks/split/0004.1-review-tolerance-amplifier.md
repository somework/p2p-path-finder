# Subtask 0004.1: Review Tolerance Amplifier Calculation

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Audit the tolerance amplifier calculation in PathFinder constructor to ensure correctness.

## Actions

- [x] Audit tolerance amplifier calculation in PathFinder constructor
- [x] Verify formula is mathematically correct
- [x] Test with tolerance = 0, 0.5, 0.999999...
- [x] Document formula in PathFinder class docblock
- [x] Add inline comments explaining the calculation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Amplifier calculation reviewed and verified correct
- Formula tested with edge case tolerances
- Formula documented in class docblock
- Mathematical correctness verified
- Edge cases tested

## Definition of Done

- [x] Amplifier calculation reviewed and verified
- [x] Edge cases tested (0, 0.5, 0.999999)
- [x] Formula documented in PathFinder docblock
- [x] Tests added if gaps found
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods if needed:
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithZeroTolerance()`
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithMediumTolerance()`
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithNearMaxTolerance()`
