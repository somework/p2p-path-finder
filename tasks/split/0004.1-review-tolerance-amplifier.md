# Subtask 0004.1: Review Tolerance Amplifier Calculation

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Audit the tolerance amplifier calculation in PathFinder constructor to ensure correctness.

## Actions

- [ ] Audit tolerance amplifier calculation in PathFinder constructor
- [ ] Verify formula is mathematically correct
- [ ] Test with tolerance = 0, 0.5, 0.999999...
- [ ] Document formula in PathFinder class docblock
- [ ] Add inline comments explaining the calculation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Amplifier calculation reviewed and verified correct
- Formula tested with edge case tolerances
- Formula documented in class docblock
- Mathematical correctness verified
- Edge cases tested

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Amplifier calculation reviewed and verified
- [ ] Edge cases tested (0, 0.5, 0.999999)
- [ ] Formula documented in PathFinder docblock
- [ ] Tests added if gaps found
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods if needed:
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithZeroTolerance()`
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithMediumTolerance()`
- `testToleranceAmplifierWithNearMaxTolerance()`
