# Subtask 0003.3: Grep Audit - PHP Math Functions

**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Search for PHP native math functions that might bypass BigDecimal and cause non-determinism.

## Actions

- [x] Search for: `round()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`
- [x] Document findings with file path and context
- [x] Evaluate if each is legitimate (test code, constants) or needs BigDecimal
- [x] Fix any that bypass BigDecimal incorrectly
- [x] Update code to use BigDecimal methods

## Acceptance Criteria

- Search completed across entire codebase
- All PHP math functions documented
- Problematic uses identified
- Legitimate uses (test mocks, constants) justified
- All problematic uses fixed

## Definition of Done

- [x] Search completed
- [x] All math functions reviewed
- [x] Problematic cases fixed
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- Run full test suite after fixes
- Verify no determinism regressions
