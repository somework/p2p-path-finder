**Parent Task**: 0003 - Decimal Arithmetic Audit  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Verify Money and ExchangeRate handle scale correctly in all operations.

## Actions

- [x] Verify Money arithmetic preserves scale correctly
- [x] Verify ExchangeRate conversion scale is max(money.scale, rate.scale)
- [x] Review scale derivation rules
- [x] Add tests if gaps found
- [x] Document scale derivation rules

## Acceptance Criteria

- ExchangeRate scale handling verified correct
- Scale derivation rules documented
- Tests added for any gaps
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [x] Money scale handling verified
- [x] ExchangeRate scale handling verified
- [x] Scale derivation rules documented
- [x] Tests added if needed
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed
