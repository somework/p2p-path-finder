# Subtask 0004.10: Test Ordering Determinism

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.9

## Description

Add comprehensive tests to verify path ordering is deterministic and stable.

## Actions

- [ ] Test large batch of equal-cost paths
- [ ] Test paths with identical cost and hops but different signatures
- [ ] Test repeated runs produce same order
- [ ] Test tie-breaking behaves as documented
- [ ] Add to PathFinderTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- Equal-cost paths ordering tested
- Identical cost+hops paths ordering tested
- Repeated runs test added and passes
- Stable ordering verified
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Ordering determinism tests added to tests/Application/PathFinder/PathFinderTest.php
- [ ] Stable ordering verified
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project testing patterns
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testEqualCostPathsOrderDeterministically()`
- `testIdenticalCostAndHopsOrderBySignature()`
- `testRepeatedRunsProduceSameOrder()`
- `testTieBreakingBehavior()`
