# Subtask 0004.2: Review Tolerance Pruning Logic

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.1

## Description

Review tolerance pruning in the search loop to ensure candidates are pruned correctly based on tolerance.

## Actions

- [x] Review tolerance pruning in PathFinder search loop
- [x] Verify candidates pruned correctly based on tolerance
- [x] Add debug logging if needed for review
- [x] Document pruning logic in code comments
- [x] Verify pruning doesn't eliminate valid paths

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pruning logic reviewed and understood
- Logic verified correct
- Pruning doesn't eliminate valid paths
- Documentation updated
- Edge cases considered

## Definition of Done

- [x] Pruning logic reviewed
- [x] Logic verified correct
- [x] Documentation updated in code
- [x] Tests verify pruning behavior
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add tests if gaps found:
- Test that valid paths within tolerance are not pruned
- Test that paths outside tolerance are pruned
- Test pruning at tolerance boundaries
