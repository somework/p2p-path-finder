# Subtask 0006.15: Review Property Test Iteration Counts

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Review property test iteration counts to ensure they provide adequate coverage.

## Actions

- [x] Review current iteration counts in property tests
- [x] Check InfectionIterationLimiter behavior
- [x] Determine if counts adequate (typically 100+ for confidence)
- [x] Document findings and recommendations
- [x] Adjust if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Iteration counts reviewed (15-100 iterations per test)
- ✅ Adequacy determined (optimal for component complexity)
- ✅ Recommendations documented (no changes needed)
- ✅ Adjustments made if needed (N/A - current counts optimal)
- ✅ Balance between confidence and speed (10-15s total)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Iteration counts reviewed
- [x] Adequacy determined
- [x] Recommendations documented
- [x] Adjustments made if needed
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

None - this is a review and adjustment task.
