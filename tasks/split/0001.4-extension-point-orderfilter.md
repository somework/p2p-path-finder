# Subtask 0001.4: Extension Point Documentation - OrderFilterInterface

**Parent Task**: 0001 - Public API Finalization  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0001.1

## Description

Document the `OrderFilterInterface` contract in detail, including performance expectations, stability guarantees, and provide a working example implementation.

## Actions

- [x] Add comprehensive PHPDoc to `OrderFilterInterface` interface
- [x] Document performance expectations (filters should be O(1) per order)
- [x] Document stability guarantees (filters must not modify orders)
- [x] Create example custom filter in `examples/custom-order-filter.php`
- [x] Test example works correctly
- [x] Add inline comments explaining best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `OrderFilterInterface` has complete PHPDoc with contract details
- [x] Performance expectations clearly documented
- [x] Stability guarantees (immutability) clearly stated
- [x] Example file `examples/custom-order-filter.php` exists and runs without errors
- [x] Example demonstrates realistic filtering scenario
- [x] Example includes comments explaining design decisions

## Definition of Done

- [x] OrderFilterInterface fully documented with PHPDoc
- [x] examples/custom-order-filter.php created and tested
- [x] Example demonstrates best practices
- [x] Example runs successfully and produces expected output
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- [x] Manual test: run `php examples/custom-order-filter.php` successfully
- [x] Verify example integrates with PathFinderService correctly
- [x] Verify example filter logic is correct
