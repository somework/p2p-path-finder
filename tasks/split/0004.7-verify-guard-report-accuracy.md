**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.6

## Description

Add tests to verify SearchGuardReport metrics accurately reflect search activity.

## Actions

- [x] Add test that verifies reported counts match actual activity
- [x] Test elapsed time measurement accuracy
- [x] Test breach flags set correctly
- [x] Created SearchGuardReportAccuracyTest with comprehensive integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests verify reported expansion count matches actual
- Tests verify reported visited state count matches actual
- Tests verify elapsed time is reasonable
- Tests verify breach flags correct
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [x] Guard report accuracy tests added to SearchGuardReportAccuracyTest.php
- [x] All metrics verified accurate (9 tests, 48 assertions)
- [x] All tests pass
