# Subtask 0004.7: Verify Guard Report Accuracy

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.6

## Description

Add tests to verify SearchGuardReport metrics accurately reflect search activity.

## Actions

- [ ] Add test that verifies reported counts match actual activity
- [ ] Test elapsed time measurement accuracy
- [ ] Test breach flags set correctly
- [ ] Add to SearchGuardsTest or create if missing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests verify reported expansion count matches actual
- Tests verify reported visited state count matches actual
- Tests verify elapsed time is reasonable
- Tests verify breach flags correct
- All tests pass

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Guard report accuracy tests added to appropriate test class
- [ ] All metrics verified accurate
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project testing patterns
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testExpansionCountAccuracy()`
- `testVisitedStateCountAccuracy()`
- `testElapsedTimeReasonable()`
- `testBreachFlagsCorrect()`
