# Subtask 0001.9: JSON Serialization Contract - Money & Domain VOs

**Parent Task**: 0001 - Public API Finalization  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: 0001.7

## Description

Document the JSON serialization format for `Money` and other serializable domain value objects.

## Actions

- [x] Document Money serialization format (currency, amount, scale)
- [x] Identify other serializable domain VOs
- [x] Document their serialization formats
- [x] Add to docs/api-contracts.md
- [x] Include examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Money serialization format documented (e.g., `{"currency":"USD","amount":"100.50","scale":2}`)
- [x] All other serializable domain VOs identified and documented
- [x] Examples included for each
- [x] Format consistent with BigDecimal string representation

## Definition of Done

- [x] Money serialization format documented
- [x] All serializable domain VOs documented
- [x] Examples clear and accurate
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Notes

Money serialization was already documented in task 0001.7. Added DecimalTolerance documentation to docs/api-contracts.md. DecimalTolerance serializes to a simple numeric string (not an object like Money), representing a ratio between 0 and 1.

## Tests Needed

None directly for this documentation task, but see 0001.10 for JSON serialization tests.
