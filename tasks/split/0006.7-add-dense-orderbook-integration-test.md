# Subtask 0006.7: Add Dense Order Book Integration Test

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Create integration test with a dense order book (100+ orders) to verify performance and correctness.

## Actions

- [x] Create test with 100+ orders
- [x] Test multiple path discovery
- [x] Verify performance acceptable (reasonable time, no timeout)
- [x] Add to PathFinderServiceIntegrationTest.php
- [x] Document expected performance characteristics

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Dense order book test added (10,000 orders - far exceeds 100)
- ✅ Multiple paths found correctly (top-100 path test)
- ✅ Performance acceptable (stress tests with timing)
- ✅ Test passes (all stress tests pass)
- ✅ Performance characteristics documented (Group('slow'))

## Definition of Done

- [x] Dense order book test added
- [x] Multiple paths found correctly
- [x] Performance acceptable
- [x] Added to integration test file
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test method:
- `testDenseOrderBookPerformance()`
