# Subtask 0006.11: Test Custom PathOrderStrategy

**Parent Task**: 0006 - Test Coverage Analysis  
**Effort**: S (1-2h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Create and test a custom PathOrderStrategy to verify the extension point works correctly.

## Actions

- [ ] Create custom ordering strategy (e.g., prefer fewer hops over cost)
- [ ] Test with equal-cost paths that differ in hops
- [ ] Verify determinism (repeated runs produce same order)
- [ ] Add to PathOrderStrategyTest.php (create if needed)
- [ ] Document strategy behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- Custom strategy implemented and tested
- Ordering behavior verified
- Determinism verified
- Test demonstrates usage
- Strategy well-documented

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Custom strategy tested
- [ ] Determinism verified
- [ ] Test demonstrates usage
- [ ] Added to appropriate test file
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testCustomPathOrderStrategy()`
- `testCustomStrategyDeterminism()`
