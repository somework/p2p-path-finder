## Summary

Added comprehensive "API Documentation" section to README.md positioned prominently after the "Public API surface" section (line 76).

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added API Documentation section** with:
   - Link to `docs/api-stability.md` - Comprehensive public API reference
   - Link to `docs/api-contracts.md` - JSON serialization contracts
   - Link to `docs/api/index.md` - Generated API documentation
   - Clear descriptions of what each document contains
   - Note about `@api` annotations and semantic versioning

2. **Section Placement**: Positioned after "Public API surface" and before "Design Notes" for maximum visibility

3. **Verified Links**: All three documentation files exist and are accessible:
   - `docs/api-stability.md` (42.7K)
   - `docs/api-contracts.md` (19.1K)
   - `docs/api/index.md` (53.6K, generated)

The documentation is now easily discoverable from the README with clear guidance on which document to use for different purposes.

## Tests Needed

- Manual verification: click all links and verify they work
- Verify links use correct relative paths
