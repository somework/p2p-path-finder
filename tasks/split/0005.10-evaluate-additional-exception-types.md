# Subtask 0005.10: Evaluate Additional Exception Types

**Parent Task**: 0005 - Exception Hierarchy  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: 0005.1, 0005.2, 0005.3

## Description

Evaluate whether additional exception types would add value to the exception hierarchy.

## Actions

- [x] Consider GraphConstructionException (for graph building errors)
- [x] Consider OrderValidationException (for order validation)
- [x] Consider ConfigurationException (for config errors)
- [x] Decide if needed based on value and usage patterns
- [x] Document decision with rationale

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Need evaluated for each potential exception type (3 candidates)
- ✅ Decision made with clear rationale for each (NOT NEEDED for all)
- ✅ If not added: rationale documented (comprehensive analysis)
- ✅ Decision documented in exceptions.md (FAQ section)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Need evaluated for each type
- [x] Decision made with rationale
- [x] If added: Exception classes created (N/A - not adding)
- [x] Decision documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

If new exceptions added:
- Add exception construction tests
- Add exception throwing tests
- Add catch strategy tests
