# Subtask 0004.9: Review Ordering Determinism

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Review path ordering implementation to ensure deterministic results.

## Actions

- [x] Verify SearchStatePriorityQueue tie-breaking logic
- [x] Verify CandidatePriorityQueue tie-breaking logic
- [x] Verify PathOrderStrategy usage and integration
- [x] Review for any sources of non-determinism (timestamps, object IDs, etc.)
- [x] Document ordering guarantees

## Acceptance Criteria

- Ordering implementation reviewed
- Tie-breaking logic verified correct
- No non-determinism sources found
- PathOrderStrategy integration correct
- Ordering guarantees documented

## Definition of Done

- [x] Ordering implementation reviewed
- [x] Tie-breaking verified correct
- [x] No non-determinism found
- [x] Findings documented
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add tests if gaps found (see 0004.10)
