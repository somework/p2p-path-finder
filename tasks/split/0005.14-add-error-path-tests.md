# Subtask 0005.14: Add Error Path Tests

**Parent Task**: 0005 - Exception Hierarchy  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0005.1, 0005.2

## Description

Add comprehensive tests for all error paths to ensure exceptions are thrown correctly.

## Actions

- [x] Test every validation that should throw an exception
- [x] Test that invalid state cannot be constructed
- [x] Test error recovery where applicable
- [x] Add tests to relevant test files
- [x] Verify exception types and messages

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All validation error paths tested (6+ domain classes, 5+ application classes)
- ✅ Invalid construction attempts tested (comprehensive coverage)
- ✅ Error recovery tested where applicable (empty results, partial results)
- ✅ Exception types verified (InvalidInput, GuardLimitExceeded, PrecisionViolation)
- ✅ Exception messages verified (tested throughout)
- ✅ Tests comprehensive (domain + application layers)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All validation error paths tested
- [x] Invalid construction attempts tested
- [x] Tests comprehensive
- [x] Added to appropriate test files
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Add error path tests across all test files:
- Domain value objects (Money, ExchangeRate, Order, etc.)
- Application services (PathFinderService, GraphBuilder, etc.)
- Configuration classes (PathSearchConfig, etc.)
