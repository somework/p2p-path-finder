# Subtask 0004.20: Document Algorithm Behavior

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.1-0004.19

## Description

Update PathFinder class documentation with comprehensive algorithm details and guarantees.

## Actions

- [ ] Update PathFinder class docblock with algorithm details
- [ ] Document tolerance handling behavior
- [ ] Document hop enforcement behavior
- [ ] Document guard behavior
- [ ] Document ordering guarantees (determinism, tie-breaking)
- [ ] Document complexity characteristics

## Acceptance Criteria

- PathFinder docblock comprehensive
- Algorithm behavior clearly documented
- All guarantees stated explicitly
- Complexity documented
- Limitations documented

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PathFinder docblock comprehensive
- [ ] Algorithm behavior clearly documented
- [ ] All guarantees stated explicitly
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for accuracy
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

None directly, but documentation should reflect actual tested behavior from 0004.1-0004.19.
