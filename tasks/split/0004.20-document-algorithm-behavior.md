# Subtask 0004.20: Document Algorithm Behavior

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.1-0004.19

## Description

Update PathFinder class documentation with comprehensive algorithm details and guarantees.

## Actions

- [x] Update PathFinder class docblock with algorithm details
- [x] Document tolerance handling behavior
- [x] Document hop enforcement behavior
- [x] Document guard behavior
- [x] Document ordering guarantees (determinism, tie-breaking)
- [x] Document complexity characteristics

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ PathFinder docblock comprehensive (250+ line docblock)
- ✅ Algorithm behavior clearly documented (pseudocode, examples)
- ✅ All guarantees stated explicitly (correctness, properties, limitations)
- ✅ Complexity documented (time: O(V×E×log(V×E)), space: O(V×S+K))
- ✅ Limitations documented (known bounds, recommended limits)

## Definition of Done

- [x] PathFinder docblock comprehensive
- [x] Algorithm behavior clearly documented
- [x] All guarantees stated explicitly
- [x] Documentation reviewed for accuracy
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

None directly, but documentation should reflect actual tested behavior from 0004.1-0004.19.
