# Subtask 0004.8: Test Guard Combinations

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.6, 0004.7

## Description

Test SearchGuards with various combinations and edge cases.

## Actions

- [x] Test multiple guards reached simultaneously
- [x] Test guards at boundary values (1 expansion, 0ms/1ms budget)
- [x] Test guards with very large limits (PHP_INT_MAX)
- [x] Test various guard combinations and edge cases
- [x] Added 11 new tests to SearchGuardsTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple guards simultaneously tested
- Boundary value guards tested
- Large limit guards tested
- Both exception and metadata modes tested
- All edge cases covered

## Definition of Done

- [x] Guard combination tests added to tests/Application/PathFinder/Guard/SearchGuardsTest.php
- [x] All edge cases covered (21 tests total, 11 new)
- [x] All tests pass (11123 assertions)
- [x] Code follows project testing patterns
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testMultipleGuardsBreachedSimultaneously()`
- `testGuardsAtBoundaryValues()`
- `testGuardsWithVeryLargeLimits()`
- `testGuardExceptionMode()`
- `testGuardMetadataMode()`
