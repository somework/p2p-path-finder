# Subtask 0004.8: Test Guard Combinations

**Parent Task**: 0004 - PathFinder Algorithm Correctness  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0004.6, 0004.7

## Description

Test SearchGuards with various combinations and edge cases.

## Actions

- [ ] Test multiple guards reached simultaneously
- [ ] Test guards at boundary values (1 expansion, 1ms budget)
- [ ] Test guards with very large limits
- [ ] Test exception vs metadata modes
- [ ] Add to SearchGuardsTest

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple guards simultaneously tested
- Boundary value guards tested
- Large limit guards tested
- Both exception and metadata modes tested
- All edge cases covered

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Guard combination tests added to tests/Application/PathFinder/SearchGuardsTest.php (or create)
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project testing patterns
- [ ] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

Create test methods:
- `testMultipleGuardsBreachedSimultaneously()`
- `testGuardsAtBoundaryValues()`
- `testGuardsWithVeryLargeLimits()`
- `testGuardExceptionMode()`
- `testGuardMetadataMode()`
