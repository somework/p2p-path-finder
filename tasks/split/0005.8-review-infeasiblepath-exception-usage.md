# Subtask 0005.8: Review InfeasiblePath Exception Usage

**Parent Task**: 0005 - Exception Hierarchy  
**Effort**: S (1h)  
**Dependencies**: 0005.3, 0005.4

## Description

Decide whether InfeasiblePath exception should be thrown by library or remain user-space.

## Actions

- [x] Decide: Should PathFinderService throw this exception?
- [x] Or should it remain a user-space exception for application logic?
- [x] Document decision in docs/exceptions.md
- [x] Update code/docs accordingly
- [x] Provide usage examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Decision made with clear rationale (remain user-space)
- ✅ Usage documented in exceptions.md (comprehensive section added)
- ✅ Code matches decision (library doesn't throw it - correct)
- ✅ Examples provided for intended usage (3 consumer examples)
- ✅ PHPDoc updated (clarified as user-space exception)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Decision made
- [x] Usage documented
- [x] Code matches decision
- [x] Examples provided
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- If library throws: add tests for InfeasiblePath exception
- If user-space: document example usage in tests or examples
