# Subtask 0001.5: Extension Point Documentation - PathOrderStrategy

**Parent Task**: 0001 - Public API Finalization  
**Effort**: M (2-3h)  
**Dependencies**: 0001.1

## Description

Document the `PathOrderStrategy` contract comprehensively, emphasizing stable sort requirements and determinism expectations, with a working example.

## Actions

- [x] Add comprehensive PHPDoc to `PathOrderStrategy` interface
- [x] Document stable sort requirements
- [x] Document determinism expectations (same inputs → same order)
- [x] Create example custom strategy in `examples/custom-ordering-strategy.php`
- [x] Test example works correctly
- [x] Show how custom strategy affects path prioritization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `PathOrderStrategy` has complete PHPDoc with contract details
- [x] Stable sorting requirements clearly documented
- [x] Determinism expectations clearly stated
- [x] Example file `examples/custom-ordering-strategy.php` exists and runs
- [x] Example demonstrates alternative ordering logic (e.g., minimize hops)
- [x] Example includes explanatory comments

## Definition of Done

- [x] PathOrderStrategy fully documented
- [x] examples/custom-ordering-strategy.php created and tested
- [x] Determinism requirements clearly stated
- [x] Example shows measurable difference from default ordering
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Changes committed to version control

## Tests Needed

- [x] Manual test: run `php examples/custom-ordering-strategy.php` successfully
- [x] Verify strategy produces consistent ordering across multiple runs
- [x] Verify strategy integrates with PathFinderService correctly
